### About Me
I am a programmer, who is enthusiast about Linux and Open-Source software in general. Beyond the technology side of my life I am very curious about the world and enjoy hiking out to areas that are seldom seen.

### About this site
This website is a area where I will drop useful information for myself, or other notes that I keep forgetting. Periodically I'll try and post helpful stuff to do with programming for anyone who happens to stumble upon the site. The site was created to allow me to play with new Python stuff I haven't touched before.
